# BlackDog Automation

BlackDog:
The Black Dog Institute is dedicated to understanding, preventing and treating mental illness. 
They help in creating a world where mental illness is treated with the same level of concern, immediacy and seriousness as physical illness; where scientists work to discover the causes of illness and new treatments, and where discoveries are immediately put into practice through health services, technology and community education.

Their survey page is automated with the help of Selenium and Java. The configuration properties and survey answers are saved in a .property file. The field values are read from the properties file and entered into the page through automation
