# BlackDog Automation

BlackDog:
The Black Dog Institute is dedicated to understanding, preventing and treating mental illness. 
They help in creating a world where mental illness is treated with the same level of concern, immediacy and seriousness as physical illness; where scientists work to discover the causes of illness and new treatments, and where discoveries are immediately put into practice through health services, technology and community education.

Their survey page is automated with the help of Selenium and Java. The automation approach is as given below:
Phase 1 - Create a regression suite on chrome with static input feed of questions, answer and question type. ( 1 week)
Phase 2 - Working on dynamic feed ( 1 week )
Phase 3 - Integration with browser stack and creating a setup for multiple browser testing. ( 1 week )
